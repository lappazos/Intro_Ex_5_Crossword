==================
=  Description:  =
==================
first of all, let us guarantee you that our code is the best there is, the most
clear, efficient, modular, organized, properly styled and just - the best!!!

3 files - crossword, crossword3d and initiate - our main file.

We tried to create the most modular code possible - we divided all of the work
into different main functions, without any code repeating.
we actually chose to perform as the following - for every set of directions we
created different matrix, running on 2 main search functions - east & west.
east west - basic version
north south - columns version
north-east south-west - diagonal version
south-east north-west - diagonal 2 version
we actually look what directions the user has requested, then create the proper
mat versions, then create all of the possible combinations one time only, then
delete the words we arent looking for fromt hat list, then counting and
writing.

once you run the script, first he will call a different script - initiate.
this is the main file where the "logistics" is implemented, all of the
functions that are actually common and extacly the same for both parts.
 - open files, writing to files, checking which words are there from all of the
possible combinations, etc.

the crossword file is where we create all of the possible combinations in the
world for a certain mat - only 2 "search" functions - east and west". the rest
of the combinations is being done by transforming the matrix itself to a
different version.

the crossword3d file is where the big 3d matrix is divided and transformed into
different directional matrix. then, for every mat, separately, we implement
crossword func from crossword file.

=  Special Comments  =
======================
the sys-arg and if"__main__" is still not perfectly clear - a few good examples
in class might be good.
